# Lead Generation API Server

A powerful API server for searching job listings, creating Google Sheets, and exporting to Excel - all with single API calls.

## Features

- üîç Search for job listings across major job sites (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.)
- üìä Export job listings directly to Google Sheets
- üìë Download job listings as Excel files
- ‚ö° All-in-one endpoints for one-step automation

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google API credentials (for search and spreadsheet functionality)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zaidusyy/lead-generation-api.git
cd lead-generation-api
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following credentials:
```
PORT=3000
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
GOOGLE_CX=your_google_custom_search_engine_id
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"..."}
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean and organized structure to make navigation and development easier:

```
lead-generation-api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js           # Main application entry point with API routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers.js        # Core business logic for handling API requests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # Project dependencies and scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env               # Environment variables (not checked into git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/      # Installed dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project documentation
```

Each file has a specific purpose:
- **index.js**: This is where we set up the Express server and define all our API endpoints
- **handlers.js**: Contains the implementation of our core features - search, spreadsheet creation, and Excel export
- **.env**: Stores all sensitive configuration like API keys (make sure not to commit this file!)

## Implementation Details

### Search Algorithm

Our search is focused on finding companies actively looking to hire. We use Google's Custom Search API with a special query that targets job listings containing "Looking for [job title]" phrases.

The search query looks something like this:
```
site:linkedin.com OR site:indeed.com OR site:glassdoor.com OR site:monster.com OR site:ziprecruiter.com "Looking for {jobTitle}" {location}
```

This helps zero in on job listings where companies explicitly mention they're looking for candidates with your specified skills.

### Data Processing

For each job listing we find, we pull out the most important information:
- The exact job title
- A direct link to apply
- A snippet of the job description
- Which website it came from (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)

This gives you a clean, organized view of potential opportunities without the clutter.

### Integration Options

You can connect this API with your:
- Job board website
- Recruitment dashboard
- Automated job application scripts
- Career coaching tools



## Error Handling

The API uses easy-to-understand HTTP status codes:

- `200`: Everything worked!
- `400`: Something's wrong with your request (missing job title, etc.)
- `500`: Something went wrong on our end

Error messages are clear and helpful:

```json
{
  "error": "Missing required parameter: jobTitle is required"
}
```

### Common Issues

**No results found**
- Try broadening your job title (e.g., "developer" instead of "senior React developer")
- Make sure location isn't too specific (try "New York" instead of "Manhattan East Village")

**Spreadsheet creation fails**
- Double-check your Google Sheets API credentials
- Make sure your service account has permission to create new spreadsheets

## API Limitations

- Google Custom Search API has a limit of 100 free queries per day
- After that, you'll be charged per additional 1000 queries
- The Google Sheets API has generous usage limits but might throttle with extremely heavy usage

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub
- Consider adding API key authentication for production
- Always validate and sanitize input data
